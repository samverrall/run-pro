# Run-Pro -- **WIP**

### What is Run-Pro?

Run-Pro is a command line tool to manage, and run your projects from a single config file. Simply add your projects to the run-pro config file, and give each project a rememberable name and run it quickly and easily from your command line.

### The aim

As a Go lang developer working with microservices, I jump around to different projects all day, having to CD and run the project manually to spin up a service. So run-pro's aim is to solve this problem.

### Simple usage

Run a project.

```
$ run-pro run project-name
```
List the projects in your config file.

```
$ run-pro list
